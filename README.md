*Tired of feeding your prisoners Lavish Meals?
Need your animal handlers to stop bonding with livestock?
Want a colonist to avoid getting a new lover?
Have a worker on construction duty but shouldn't be building artistic furniture?*

**Pawn Rules** is a mod that allows custom rules to be assigned individually to your colonists, animals, guests and prisoners. Default rules can be set for new pawns and new born animals will inherit their mother's rules.

Currently the following rules can be applied:


- Disallow certain foods
- Disallow bonding with certain animals
- Disallow new romances
- Disallow constructing items that have a quality level



Any of these rules can be disabled and hidden from the rules window. Rules presets and defaults can be imported and exported between games.

# How to open rules dialog

Select a pawn and the rules button should appear next to the draft button. If you are using https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1508850027]RimHUD then the rules button is integrated in the HUD and replaces the food restriction button.

# Technical details

No update should ever break an existing game and **this mod be added or removed at any time without issue**.

# Compatibility

This mod is not compatible with my other mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1547017052]Animal Food Restrictions as this mod has a much more robust restriction system.

# Other languages

**For translators**: Instead of including other languages with this mod, I would prefer and welcome translators to upload and maintain a language submod. If any translator would like the logo and art assets for this mod please contact me on Discord.
